With <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.asset-manager-for-unity@1.3/manual/upload-assets.html">Asset Manager for Unity Editor</a> you can easily integrate Asset Manager into the Unity Editor, allowing you to upload, download, and manage assets. Once the package is installed, you can upload assets from the Unity Editor to Asset Manager in Unity Cloud. You can search, browse, and preview cloud assets directly within the editor, making it simple to find the resources you need, from any project you prefer. Importing cloud assets into your project is effortless, and managing them becomes more convenient with features like search, re-import, and removal. This integration streamlines your workflow, making asset management in Unity more efficient and accelerating iteration time. It allows you to easily reuse assets from older projects and organize them into different domains, ensuring they are available across all projects in their most recent versions. Additionally, you can effortlessly filter assets by criteria such as Created by, Status, Type, and Updated by across all projects, making it easier to find and manage the right assets quickly.
