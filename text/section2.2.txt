The <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.asset-manager-for-unity@1.3/manual/upload-assets.html">Unity Asset Manager package</a> integrates directly with the Unity Editor, allowing you to manage assets without disrupting your workflow. After installation, you can upload and download assets to Unity Cloud and access assets from all your projects through the editor's search interface. You can filter assets by creator, status, type, and update time, which helps locate specific resources efficiently. The plugin automatically detects dependencies across assetsâ€”for example, if multiple prefabs use the same material, only one instance of the material is uploaded. This ensures optimized storage and prevents unnecessary duplication. 
This integration works well for editor-focused workflows, especially when team members frequently iterate on assets. You can reuse assets from previous projects and ensure you're working with the latest versions. By centralizing asset organization, you reduce duplicate work and maintain consistency across your projects.
