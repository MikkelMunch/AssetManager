<H3>Asset Manager for Unity Editor</H3>The <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/unity-cloud-python-sdk-samples">Unity Cloud Python SDK</a> serves as a command-line interface (CLI) for performing bulk operations. The Bulk Upload CLI is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of uploading and downloading assets in Asset Manager. It allows users to efficiently transfer large volumes of local assets to the cloud by creating structured configuration files. The tool supports various input methods, including CSV-based ingestion, direct Unity package extraction, or folder-based selection, ensuring flexibility in handling different asset structures.
                                                                                                              During the upload process, the CLI validates asset data and provides an overview of the number of files and total size before proceeding. Users can fine-tune upload parameters, such as parallel asset creation and file transfer limits, to optimize performance based on network conditions. 
                                                                                                              For bulk downloads, the CLI provides a Python-based script that retrieves assets from Unity Cloud Asset Manager. Users can filter assets by organization, project, or collection, and specify download directories with options to overwrite or skip existing files. The script also supports metadata filtering, enabling precise asset retrieval while maintaining project structure.
                                                                                                              By automating asset transfers, the Bulk Upload CLI streamlines content management workflows, making it an essential tool for teams handling large-scale 3D asset pipelines in Unity Cloud.


<H3>Pixyz SDK</H3>The <a href="https://unity.com/products/pixyz-sdk">Pixyz SDK</a> hoffers the Pixyz technology to integrate with Unity’s Asset Manager to provide programmatic access to 3D asset transformation and optimization at scale. As the backbone of Unity’s transformation solutions - including Pixyz Studio, Pixyz Plugin 3.0, and Unity Asset Manager - it enhances real-time visualization, CAD-to-RT3D workflows, game asset optimization, and XR experiences.
                                                                  The SDK includes C# and Python APIs, allowing developers to automate asset processing with tools for mesh repair, reduction, UV unwrapping, and smart merging using a set of 200+ built-in algorithms. It supports over 70 file formats, facilitating the ingestion of CAD, BIM, and point cloud data for various industrial and engineering applications.
                                                                  Designed for flexibility and scalability, the Pixyz SDK runs on-premise, including in air-gapped environments, or as a cloud-ready Docker image. It can be deployed in local or remote infrastructures to handle high-polygon CAD models and optimize assets for real-time applications, maintaining data fidelity while improving processing efficiency.

<H3>Asset Manager SDK</H3>Unity Asset Manager provides a comprehensive solution for managing 3D assets in Unity Cloud, offering both a REST API and an SDK to support different integration needs. The <a href="https://services.docs.unity.com/assets-manager/v1/#tag/Asset-management">REST API</a> enables programmatic control over asset management, allowing users to automate asset creations, versioning, retrieval, and processing. This approach is ideal for developers integrating Asset Manager into existing pipelines, third-party applications, or custom automation workflows. The API provides flexibility for managing assets at scale, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow for 3D content management.

For Unity developers, the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cloud.assets@0.2/manual/get-started-discovery.html">Asset Manager SDK</a> offers a seamless way to work with assets directly inside Unity. It abstracts API calls into pre-built functions, making it easy to discover, create, update, delete, and manage assets without manually handling API requests. The SDK ensures a smooth integration with Unity Editor workflows, allowing developers to focus on asset organization and collaboration rather than low-level implementation details. The SDK buffers your application from your API, so you can update the SDK to support API changes without needing to immediately make changes to your application code.

To help users understand how the Unity SDKs can be used, Unity provides the <a href="https://unityviewerproj.cds.unity3d.com/">Industry Viewer Template</a>, available as a WebGL Demo. This template demonstrates how the SDK facilitates asset viewing, organization, and collaboration in a real-world scenario, giving teams a preview of the SDK’s capabilities before implementation.
