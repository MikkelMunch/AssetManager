The <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/unity-cloud-python-sdk-samples">Unity Cloud Python SDK</a> serves as a command-line interface (CLI) for performing bulk operations. The Bulk Upload CLI is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of uploading and downloading assets in Asset Manager. It allows users to efficiently transfer large volumes of local assets to the cloud by creating structured configuration files. The tool supports various input methods, including CSV-based ingestion, direct Unity package extraction, or folder-based selection, ensuring flexibility in handling different asset structures.
                                                                                                              During the upload process, the CLI validates asset data and provides an overview of the number of files and total size before proceeding. Users can fine-tune upload parameters, such as parallel asset creation and file transfer limits, to optimize performance based on network conditions. 
                                                                                                              For bulk downloads, the CLI provides a Python-based script that retrieves assets from Unity Cloud Asset Manager. Users can filter assets by organization, project, or collection, and specify download directories with options to overwrite or skip existing files. The script also supports metadata filtering, enabling precise asset retrieval while maintaining project structure.
                                                                                                              By automating asset transfers, the Unity Cloud Python SDK streamlines content management workflows, making it an essential tool for teams handling large-scale 3D asset pipelines in Unity Cloud.
