Unity Asset Manager provides a comprehensive solution for managing 3D assets in Unity Cloud, offering both a REST API and an SDK to support different integration needs. The <a href="https://services.docs.unity.com/assets-manager/v1/#tag/Asset-management">REST API</a> enables programmatic control over asset management, allowing users to automate asset creations, versioning, retrieval, and processing. This approach is ideal for developers integrating Asset Manager into existing pipelines, third-party applications, or custom automation workflows. The API provides flexibility for managing assets at scale, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow for 3D content management.

For Unity developers, the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cloud.assets@1.6/manual/installation.html">Asset Manager SDK</a> offers a way to work with assets directly inside Unity. It abstracts API calls into pre-built functions, making it easy to discover, create, update, delete, and manage assets without manually handling API requests. The SDK ensures a smooth integration with Unity Editor workflows, allowing developers to focus on asset organization and collaboration rather than low-level implementation details. The SDK buffers your application from your API, so you can update the SDK to support API changes without needing to immediately make changes to your application code.

To help users understand how the Unity SDKs can be used, Unity provides the <a href="https://unityviewerproj.cds.unity3d.com/">Industry Viewer Template</a>, available as a WebGL Demo. This template demonstrates how the SDK facilitates asset viewing, organization, and collaboration in a real-world scenario, giving teams a preview of the SDKâ€™s capabilities before implementation.
