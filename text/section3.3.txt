Unity Asset Manager can also be used utilizing our <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cloud.assets@0.2/manual/index.html">Asset Manager SDK</a> and the <a href="https://services.docs.unity.com/assets-manager/v1/#tag/Asset-management">Asset Manager REST API</a>, which supports different integration needs, e.g., a proprietary app to access and review assets.  

The <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cloud.assets@0.2/manual/index.html">Asset Manager SDK</a> offers a way to work with assets directly inside Unity. It abstracts API calls into pre-built functions, making it easy to discover, create, update, delete, and manage assets without manually handling API requests. The SDK ensures integration with Unity Editor workflows, containing pre-built components that serialize requests and handle errors to simplify communication between the client and the Unity Asset Manager. The SDK buffers your application from the API, allowing you to update it to support API changes without immediately modifying your application code.  

The SDK offers different <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cloud.assets@0.2/manual/use-case-aggregate-assets.html">use cases</a>, and to help users understand how the Unity SDKs can be used, Unity provides the <a href="https://unityviewerproj.cds.unity3d.com/">Industry Viewer Template</a>, available as a WebGL Demo. This template demonstrates how the SDK facilitates asset viewing, organization, and collaboration in a real-world scenario, giving teams a preview of the SDKâ€™s capabilities before implementation.  

The <a href="https://services.docs.unity.com/assets-manager/v1/#tag/Asset-management">Asset Manager REST API</a> enables programmatic control over asset management, allowing users to automate asset creations, versioning, retrieval, and processing. This approach is ideal for developers integrating Asset Manager into existing pipelines, third-party applications, or custom automation workflows. The API provides flexibility for managing assets at scale, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow for 3D content management.
