<H3>Web Interface</H3>The <a href="https://unity.com/products/asset-manager">Web Interface</a>  is the main web-based platform for Asset Manager, allowing you to manage, view, and organize assets through your browser. It provides a centralized hub for team collaboration on asset-related tasks and activities. It is an intuitive interface for you, no matter your role, to easily upload your assets from your favourite tools like Autodesk, Maya, Figma, Blender, Photoshop or even Digital Audio Workstations. The interface provides an option for adding metadata and tagging combined with intuitive collection control, version history, drag-and-drop ingestion, in-app preview of large CAD files, and integrations with Version Control. The interface also includes <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/feature-release-optimize-and-convert-your-3d-assets/1600288">Optimize and Convert</a>, a built-in pipeline that allows you to efficiently optimize and convert supported 3D files into various general exchange formats. 
To get started, log into Unity Cloud using your Unity ID or by creating a new Unity Cloud account. From the Unity Cloud Product page, navigate to Asset Manager, create a project, add your assets, and invite teammates to collaborate. Once an asset is uploaded, it can be associated with multiple projects, making it easy to reuse assets from previous projects.
<H3>Asset Manager for Unity Editor</H3>With <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.asset-manager-for-unity@1.3/manual/upload-assets.html">Asset Manager for Unity Editor</a> you can easily integrate Asset Manager into the Unity Editor, allowing you to upload, download, and manage assets. Once the package is installed, you can upload assets from the Unity Editor to Asset Manager in Unity Cloud. You can search, browse, and preview cloud assets directly within the editor, making it simple to find the resources you need, from any project you prefer. Importing cloud assets into your project is effortless, and managing them becomes more convenient with features like search, re-import, and removal. This integration streamlines your workflow, making asset management in Unity more efficient and accelerating iteration time. It allows you to easily reuse assets from older projects and organize them into different domains, ensuring they are available across all projects in their most recent versions. Additionally, you can effortlessly filter assets by criteria such as Created by, Status, Type, and Updated by across all projects, making it easier to find and manage the right assets quickly.
<H3>Pixyz Studio Integration</H3>The <a href="https://www.pixyz-software.com/documentations/studio/2024.1/manual/UploadToAssetManager.html">Pixyz Studio integration</a> with Unity Cloud Asset Manager enables uploading of prepared 3D scenes for storage, sharing, and further transformation. Within Pixyz Studio, users can import and assemble multiple 3D files, optimize them interactively, and then upload the refined models directly to Asset Manager. This workflow is particularly useful for teams collaborating on high-precision 3D data preparation for engineering, manufacturing, and visualization.
                                                                                                                                            To upload a scene, users must sign in with their Unity ID, select the target Organization and Project, and initiate the upload through the File menu. The process exports the scene locally as a temporary .glb file before transferring it to Unity Cloud, ensuring a smooth transition from local editing to cloud-based collaboration.
                                                                                                                                            However, the upload process is not iterativeâ€”each upload creates a new asset rather than updating an existing one. Additionally, only uploads are supported, meaning users cannot retrieve assets from the Asset Manager back into Pixyz Studio for further optimization. Despite these limitations, the integration significantly enhances 3D asset management workflows, allowing teams to maintain a streamlined pipeline from preparation to cloud-based distribution.
