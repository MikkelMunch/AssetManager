<H2>Visual Tools</H2>The Asset Manager provides several ways of uploading your asset depending on your needs and references. 
<br>The <a href="https://unity.com/products/asset-manager">Web Interface</a>  is the main web-based platform for Asset Manager, allowing users to manage, view, and organize assets through their browser. It provides a centralized hub for team collaboration on asset-related tasks and activities. It is an intuitive interface for you as a designer and artist to easily upload your assets from your favourite tools like Autodesk, Maya, Figma, Blender, Photoshop or even Digital Audio Workstations. The interface provides an option for adding metadata tagging combined with intuitive collection control, version history, drag-and-drop ingestion, in-app preview of large CAD files, and integrations with Version Control. The interface also includes <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/feature-release-optimize-and-convert-your-3d-assets/1600288">Optimize and Convert</a>, a built-in pipeline that allows you to efficiently optimize and convert supported 3D files into various general exchange formats.
<br>With <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.asset-manager-for-unity@1.3/manual/upload-assets.html">Asset Manager for Unity Editor</a> you can easily integrate Asset Manager into the Unity Editor, allowing you to upload, download, and manage assets. Once the package is installed, you can seamlessly upload assets from the Unity Editor to Asset Manager in Unity Cloud. You can search, browse, and preview cloud assets directly within the editor, making it simple to find the resources you need, from any project you prefer. Importing cloud assets into your project is effortless, and managing them becomes more convenient with features like search, re-import, and removal. This integration streamlines your workflow, making asset management in Unity more efficient than ever.
<br>The <a href="https://www.pixyz-software.com/documentations/studio/2024.1/manual/UploadToAssetManager.html">Pixyz Studio integration</a> with Unity Cloud Asset Manager enables seamless uploading of prepared 3D scenes for storage, sharing, and further transformation. Within Pixyz Studio, users can import and assemble multiple 3D files, optimize them interactively, and then upload the refined models directly to Asset Manager. This workflow is particularly useful for teams collaborating on high-precision 3D data preparation for engineering, manufacturing, and visualization.
To upload a scene, users must sign in with their Unity ID, select the target Organization and Project, and initiate the upload through the File menu. The process exports the scene locally as a temporary .glb file before transferring it to Unity Cloud, ensuring a smooth transition from local editing to cloud-based collaboration.
<H2>Programmatically Tools</H2>The <strong>Pixyz SDK</strong> leverages Pixyz technology to provide programmatic access to Asset Manager functionalities. It supports asset optimization and prepares assets for Unity Editor, with tools for processing and converting various file formats.
<br>The <strong>REST API</strong> offers direct integration options with Asset Manager for custom implementations and automation. It enables programmatic control over asset management and easily integrates into existing tools and workflows.
<br>The <strong>Unity Cloud Python SDK</strong> serves as a command-line interface (CLI) for performing bulk operations. It facilitates automated asset uploads from Unity projects, supports batch processing, and is particularly beneficial when migrating large quantities of assets.
Custom solutions like Blender or Pixyz Studio uploads tools inside their editor


Choosing the right upload method depends on project needs, scale, and workflow complexity. The Bulk Upload CLI is particularly beneficial for teams handling large volumes of assets, requiring metadata integration, or needing automated validation.
