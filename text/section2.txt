The <a href="https://unity.com/products/asset-manager">Web Interface</a> is the main web-based platform for Asset Manager, allowing you to manage, view, and organize assets through your browser. It serves as a centralized hub for team collaboration on asset-related tasks, providing flexible options for adding assets—whether individually or in bulk—and organizing them into collections.
The platform supports <a href="https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/asset-manager/supported-file-types">70+ file formats</a> from industry-standard tools such as Autodesk, Maya, Figma, Blender, Photoshop, and Digital Audio Workstations. You can enrich assets with <a href="https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/asset-manager/manage-custom-metadata">custom metadata</a>, where admins, owners, and managers can define new metadata fields, while all users can add tags or leverage AI-suggested tags for better organization.
With the Web Interface, you can create and manage collections, move assets between collections or projects, and track <a href="https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/asset-manager/asset-versioning">version history</a>. The platform also supports previewing large CAD files and streamlining asset iteration through an integrated comment system.
Additionally, the interface features Optimize and Convert, a built-in pipeline for 3D file optimization and format conversion. The Asset Optimization tools help resolve mesh issues, intelligently merge meshes, and reduce polygon counts for improved performance. Meanwhile, the File Conversion feature allows seamless transformation of assets into formats like FBX, GLB, OBJ, and CAD, ensuring compatibility across different workflows.
