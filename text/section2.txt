<H2>Visual Tools</H2>The Asset Manager provides several ways of uploading your asset depending on your needs and references. 
<br>The <a href="https://unity.com/products/asset-manager">Web Interface</a>  is the main web-based platform for Asset Manager, allowing users to manage, view, and organize assets through their browser. It provides a centralized hub for team collaboration on asset-related tasks and activities. It is an intuitive interface for you as a designer and artist to easily upload your assets from your favourite tools like Autodesk, Maya, Figma, Blender, Photoshop or even Digital Audio Workstations. The interface provides an option for adding metadata tagging combined with intuitive collection control, version history, drag-and-drop ingestion, in-app preview of large CAD files, and integrations with Version Control. The interface also includes <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/feature-release-optimize-and-convert-your-3d-assets/1600288">Optimize and Convert</a>, a built-in pipeline that allows you to efficiently optimize and convert supported 3D files into various general exchange formats.
<br>With <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.asset-manager-for-unity@1.3/manual/upload-assets.html">Asset Manager for Unity Editor</a> you can easily integrate Asset Manager into the Unity Editor, allowing you to upload, download, and manage assets. Once the package is installed, you can seamlessly upload assets from the Unity Editor to Asset Manager in Unity Cloud. You can search, browse, and preview cloud assets directly within the editor, making it simple to find the resources you need, from any project you prefer. Importing cloud assets into your project is effortless, and managing them becomes more convenient with features like search, re-import, and removal. This integration streamlines your workflow, making asset management in Unity more efficient than ever.
<br>The <a href="https://www.pixyz-software.com/documentations/studio/2024.1/manual/UploadToAssetManager.html">Pixyz Studio integration</a> with Unity Cloud Asset Manager enables seamless uploading of prepared 3D scenes for storage, sharing, and further transformation. Within Pixyz Studio, users can import and assemble multiple 3D files, optimize them interactively, and then upload the refined models directly to Asset Manager. This workflow is particularly useful for teams collaborating on high-precision 3D data preparation for engineering, manufacturing, and visualization.
                                                                                                                                          To upload a scene, users must sign in with their Unity ID, select the target Organization and Project, and initiate the upload through the File menu. The process exports the scene locally as a temporary .glb file before transferring it to Unity Cloud, ensuring a smooth transition from local editing to cloud-based collaboration.
                                                                                                                                            However, the upload process is not iterative—each upload creates a new asset rather than updating an existing one. Additionally, only uploads are supported, meaning users cannot retrieve assets from the Asset Manager back into Pixyz Studio for further optimization. Despite these limitations, the integration significantly enhances 3D asset management workflows, allowing teams to maintain a streamlined pipeline from preparation to cloud-based distribution ￼.

<H2>Programmatically Tools</H2>The <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/unity-cloud-python-sdk-samples">Unity Cloud Python SDK</a> serves as a command-line interface (CLI) for performing bulk operations. The Bulk Upload CLI is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of uploading and updating assets in Asset Manager. It allows users to efficiently transfer large volumes of local assets to the cloud by creating structured configuration files. The tool supports various input methods, including CSV-based ingestion, direct Unity package extraction, or folder-based selection, ensuring flexibility in handling different asset structures.
                               During the upload process, the CLI validates asset data and provides an overview of the number of files and total size before proceeding. Users can fine-tune upload parameters, such as parallel asset creation and file transfer limits, to optimize performance based on network conditions. 
                               For bulk downloads, the CLI provides a Python-based script that retrieves assets from Unity Cloud Asset Manager. Users can filter assets by organization, project, or collection, and specify download directories with options to overwrite or skip existing files. The script also supports metadata filtering, enabling precise asset retrieval while maintaining project structure.
                               By automating asset transfers, the Bulk Upload CLI streamlines content management workflows, making it an essential tool for teams handling large-scale 3D asset pipelines in Unity Cloud.
