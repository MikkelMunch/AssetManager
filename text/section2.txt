The <a href="https://unity.com/products/asset-manager">Web Interface</a>  is the main web-based platform for Asset Manager, allowing you to manage, view, and organize assets through your browser. It provides a centralized hub for team collaboration on asset-related tasks and activities. It is an intuitive interface for you, no matter your role, to easily upload your assets from your favourite tools like Autodesk, Maya, Figma, Blender, Photoshop or even Digital Audio Workstations. The interface provides an option for adding metadata and tagging combined with intuitive collection control, version history, drag-and-drop ingestion, in-app preview of large CAD files, and integrations with Version Control. The interface also includes <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/feature-release-optimize-and-convert-your-3d-assets/1600288">Optimize and Convert</a>, a built-in pipeline that allows you to efficiently optimize and convert supported 3D files into various general exchange formats. 
To get started, log into Unity Cloud using your Unity ID or by creating a new Unity Cloud account. From the Unity Cloud Product page, navigate to Asset Manager, create a project, add your assets, and invite teammates to collaborate. Once an asset is uploaded, it can be associated with multiple projects, making it easy to reuse assets from previous projects.
