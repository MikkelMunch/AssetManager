The <a href="https://www.pixyz-software.com/documentations/studio/2024.1/manual/UploadToAssetManager.html">Pixyz Studio integration</a> with Unity Cloud Asset Manager enables uploading of prepared 3D scenes for storage, sharing, and further transformation. Within Pixyz Studio, users can import and assemble multiple 3D files, optimize them interactively, and then upload the refined models directly to Asset Manager. This workflow is particularly useful for teams collaborating on high-precision 3D data preparation for engineering, manufacturing, and visualization.
To upload a scene, users must sign in with their Unity ID, select the target Organization and Project, and initiate the upload through the File menu. The process exports the scene locally as a temporary .glb file before transferring it to Unity Cloud, ensuring a smooth transition from local editing to cloud-based collaboration.
However, the upload process is not iterativeâ€”each upload creates a new asset rather than updating an existing one. Additionally, only uploads are supported, meaning users cannot retrieve assets from the Asset Manager back into Pixyz Studio for further optimization.
