The <a href="https://unity.com/products/pixyz-sdk">Pixyz SDK</a> offers the Pixyz technology to integrate with Unity’s Asset Manager to provide programmatic access to 3D asset transformation and optimization at scale. As the backbone of Unity’s transformation solutions—including Pixyz Studio, Pixyz Plugin 3.0, and Unity Asset Manager—it enhances real-time visualization, CAD-to-RT3D workflows, game asset optimization, and XR experiences and is the right choice if you are looking for a programmatic and scalable way to optimize 3D assets using Pixyz and automate their transfer to the cloud.  

The <a href="https://www.pixyz-software.com/documentations/sdk/2024.2/manual/installation/python.html">SDK</a> includes C# and Python APIs, allowing developers to automate asset processing with tools for mesh repair, reduction, UV unwrapping, and smart merging using a set of 200+ built-in algorithms. It supports over 70 file formats, facilitating the ingestion of CAD, BIM, and point cloud data for various industrial and engineering applications.  

The Pixyz SDK is running both on-premises—including in air-gapped environments—and as a cloud-ready <a href="https://www.pixyz-software.com/documentations/sdk/2024.2/manual/installation/docker.html">Docker</a> image. It can be deployed across local and remote infrastructures, making it an obvious choice for secure and restricted network environments. A <a href="https://www.pixyz-software.com/documentations/sdk/2024.2/manual/installation/license/licensingintro.html">license</a> is required to run Pixyz SDK.
