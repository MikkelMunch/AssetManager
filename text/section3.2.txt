The <a href="https://unity.com/products/pixyz-sdk">Pixyz SDK</a> offers the Pixyz technology to integrate with Unity’s Asset Manager to provide programmatic access to 3D asset transformation and optimization at scale. As the backbone of Unity’s transformation solutions - including Pixyz Studio, Pixyz Plugin 3.0, and Unity Asset Manager - it enhances real-time visualization, CAD-to-RT3D workflows, game asset optimization, and XR experiences.
                                                                  The SDK includes C# and Python APIs, allowing developers to automate asset processing with tools for mesh repair, reduction, UV unwrapping, and smart merging using a set of 200+ built-in algorithms. It supports over 70 file formats, facilitating the ingestion of CAD, BIM, and point cloud data for various industrial and engineering applications.
                                                                  Designed for flexibility and scalability, the Pixyz SDK runs on-premise, including in air-gapped environments, or as a cloud-ready Docker image. It can be deployed in local or remote infrastructures to handle high-polygon CAD models and optimize assets for real-time applications, maintaining data fidelity while improving processing efficiency.
